Pages 1 and 2 - 0x0020 .. 0x005F - identification block, 64 B, located by

	+0x10 -> name              24 B  fixed width, NOT NUL-terminated,
									 zero padded when shorter than 24 chars,
									 a 24-char name fills the whole field
	+0x28 -> software version   4 B
	+0x2C -> hardware revision  4 B
	+0x30 .. +0x3F -> reserved (16 B spare)
